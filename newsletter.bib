	abstract = {With the availability of high-quality full genome polymorphism (SNPs) data, it becomes feasible to study the past demographic and selective history of populations in exquisite detail. However, such inferences still suffer from a lack of statistical resolution for recent, for example bottlenecks, events, and/or for populations with small nucleotide diversity. Additional heritable (epi)genetic markers, such as indels, transposable elements, microsatellites, or cytosine methylation, may provide further, yet untapped, information on the recent past population history. We extend the Sequential Markovian Coalescent (SMC) framework to jointly use SNPs and other hyper-mutable markers. We are able to (1) improve the accuracy of demographic inference in recent times, (2) uncover past demographic events hidden to SNP-based inference methods, and (3) infer the hyper-mutable marker mutation rates under a finite site model. As a proof of principle, we focus on demographic inference in Arabidopsis thaliana using DNA methylation diversity data from 10 European natural accessions. We demonstrate that segregating single methylated polymorphisms (SMPs) satisfy the modeling assumptions of the SMC framework, while differentially methylated regions (DMRs) are not suitable as their length exceeds that of the genomic distance between two recombination events. Combining SNPs and SMPs while accounting for site- and region-level epimutation processes, we provide new estimates of the glacial age bottleneck and post-glacial population expansion of the European A. thaliana population. Our SMC framework readily accounts for a wide range of heritable genomic markers, thus paving the way for next-generation inference of evolutionary history by combining information from several genetic and epigenetic markers.},

	abstract = {Admixture is a common phenomenon in human populations, resulting from the mating of individuals from two or more previously isolated populations. This can lead to the formation of mosaic DNA segments, with each segment originating from a different ancestral population. Local ancestry inference methods are used to identify the ancestry of each segment, which can provide insights into the history of admixture in a population. Many local ancestry inference (LAI) methods require the determination of various parameters that may be difficult to obtain, which can hamper using LAI methods. In this paper, we present a novel method for identifying approximate boundaries of ancestry change (IABAC) in admixed haplotypes and then determining the ancestry between boundaries. Unlike many LAI methods, our method does not rely on many statistical or biological parameters, therefore more robust to variations in admixture patterns. We evaluate our method on human data, and show that it is more accurate than existing methods for ancestry detection. Our results suggest that IABAC is a promising new method for identifying ancestry boundaries in admixed haplotypes. This method could be used to study the history of admixture in human populations, and to identify genetic variants that are associated with different ancestral populations.},

Various methods have been developed to utilize IBD sharing for demographic inference in contemporary DNA data. Recent methodological advances have enabled the screening for IBD in ancient DNA (aDNA) data, making demographic inference based on IBD also possible for aDNA. However, aDNA data typically have varying sampling times, but most demographic inference methods designed for modern data assume that sampling is contemporaneous. Here, we present TTNE (Time-Transect Ne), which models time-transect sampling to improve inference of recent effective population size trajectories. Using simulations, we show that utilizing IBD sharing in time series has increased resolution to infer recent fluctuations in effective population sizes compared to methods that only use contemporaneous samples. Finally, we developed an approach for estimating and modeling IBD detection errors in empirical IBD analysis. To showcase the practical utility of TTNE, we applied it to two time transects of ancient genomes, individuals associated with the Corded Ware Culture (CWC) and Medieval England. In both cases, we found evidence of a growing population, a signal consistent with archaeological records.},

Most existing ancestry inference approaches focus on calling these segments for the extant individual. In this paper, we present a general ancestry inference approach for inferring recent ancestors from an extant genome. Given the genome of an individual from a recently admixed population, our method can estimate the proportions of the genomes of the recent ancestors of this individual that originated from some ancestral populations. The key step of our method is the inference of ancestors (called founders) right after the formation of an admixed population. The inferred founders can then be used to infer the ancestry of recent ancestors of an extant individual. Our method is implemented in a computer program called PedMix2. To the best of our knowledge, there is no existing method that can practically infer ancestors beyond grandparents from an extant individual’s genome. Results on both simulated and real data show that PedMix2 performs well in ancestry inference.},

	abstract = {Inferring the demographic history of populations provides fundamental insights into species dynamics and is essential for developing a null model to accurately study selective processes. However, background selection and selective sweeps can produce genomic signatures at linked sites that mimic or mask signals associated with historical population size change. While the theoretical biases introduced by the linked effects of selection have been well established, it is unclear whether ancestral recombination graph (ARG)-based approaches to demographic inference in typical empirical analyses are susceptible to misinference due to these effects. To address this, we developed highly realistic forward simulations of human and Drosophila melanogaster populations, including empirically estimated variability of gene density, mutation rates, recombination rates, purifying, and positive selection, across different historical demographic scenarios, to broadly assess the impact of selection on demographic inference using a genealogy-based approach. Our results indicate that the linked effects of selection minimally impact demographic inference for human populations, although it could cause misinference in populations with similar genome architecture and population parameters experiencing more frequent recurrent sweeps. We found that accurate demographic inference of D. melanogaster populations by ARG-based methods is compromised by the presence of pervasive background selection alone, leading to spurious inferences of recent population expansion, which may be further worsened by recurrent sweeps, depending on the proportion and strength of beneficial mutations. Caution and additional testing with species-specific simulations are needed when inferring population history with non-human populations using ARG-based approaches to avoid misinference due to the linked effects of selection.},

An approach for fully agnostic demographic inference from these sample allele spectra is explored, and sufficient statistics for stepwise changes in population size are found. Further, convergence behaviours of the polymorphic sample spectra for population size changes on different time scales are examined and discussed within the context of inference of the effective population size. Joint visual assessment of the sample spectra and the temporal coefficients of the spectral decomposition of the forward diffusion process is found to be important in determining departure from equilibrium. Stochastic changes in (effective) population size are shown to shape sample spectra particularly strongly.},

These data structures are computationally and storage efficient, but are not interchangeable with existing data structures used for many population genetic inference methodologies such as the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) applied to population genetic alignments. To better utilize these new data structures we propose and implement a graph convolutional network (GCN) to directly learn from tree sequence topology and node data, allowing for the use of neural network applications without an intermediate step of converting tree sequences to population genetic alignment format. We then compare our approach to standard CNN approaches on a set of previously defined benchmarking tasks including recombination rate estimation, positive selection detection, introgression detection, and demographic model parameter inference. We show that tree sequences can be directly learned from using a GCN approach and can be used to perform well on these common population genetics inference tasks with accuracies roughly matching or even exceeding that of a CNN-based method. As tree sequences become more widely used in population genetics research we foresee developments and optimizations of this work to provide a foundation for population genetics inference moving forward.},

The space of possible AGs relating populations is vast, and thus most published studies have identified fitting AGs through a manual process driven by prior hypotheses, leaving the majority of alternative models unexplored. Here, we develop a method for systematically searching the space of all AGs that can incorporate non-genetic information in the form of topology constraints. We implement this findGraphs tool within a software package, ADMIXTOOLS 2, which is a reimplementation of the ADMIXTOOLS software with new features and large performance gains. We apply this methodology to identify alternative models to AGs that played key roles in eight publications and find that in nearly all cases many alternative models fit nominally or significantly better than the published one. Our results suggest that strong claims about population history from AGs should only be made when all well-fitting and temporally plausible models share common topological features. Our re-evaluation of published data also provides insight into the population histories of humans, dogs, and horses, identifying features that are stable across the models we explored, as well as scenarios of populations relationships that differ in important ways from models that have been highlighted in the literature.},

Here, we present donni (demography optimization via neural network inference), a new inference method based on dadi that is more efficient while maintaining comparable inference accuracy. For each dadi-supported demographic model, donni simulates the expected AFS for a range of model parameters then trains a set of Mean Variance Estimation neural networks using the simulated AFS. Trained networks can then be used to instantaneously infer the model parameters from future genomic data summarized by an AFS. We demonstrate that for many demographic models, donni can infer some parameters, such as population size changes, very well and other parameters, such as migration rates and times of demographic events, fairly well. Importantly, donni provides both parameter and confidence interval estimates from input AFS with accuracy comparable to parameters inferred by dadi’s likelihood optimization while bypassing its long and computationally intensive evaluation process. donni’s performance demonstrates that supervised machine learning algorithms may be a promising avenue for developing more sustainable and computationally efficient demographic history inference methods.},

Understanding the underlying genomic patterns can allow the prediction of future maladaptation and ecosystem stability. Here, we report the whole-genome resequencing of 874 individuals from 100 range-wide populations of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), one of the most important forest tree species in Europe. We show that genetic variation closely mirrors geography with a clear pattern of isolation-by-distance. Genome-wide analyses for genotype-environment associations (GEAs) identified relatively few potentially adaptive variants after correcting for an overwhelming signal of statistically significant but non-causal GEAs. We characterized the single high confidence genomic region and pinpoint a candidate gene possibly involved in winter temperature adaptation acting by modulating spring phenology. Surprisingly, however, allelic variation at this locus did not result in any apparent fitness differences in a common garden. More generally, reciprocal transplant experiments across large climate distances demonstrated extensive phenotypic plasticity. Nevertheless, we find indications of polygenic adaptation which may be essential in natural ecosystems. This polygenic signal exhibits broad- and fine-scale variation across the landscape highlighting the relevance of spatial resolution. In summary, our results emphasize the importance but also exemplify the complexity of employing natural genetic variation for forest conservation under climate change.},

Assuming a general life cycle, we derive an expression for the effective migration rate when local adaptation is due to genetic variation at many loci under directional selection on the island, allowing for arbitrary fitness and dominance effects across loci. We show how the effective migration rate can be combined with classical single-locus diffusion theory to accurately predict multilocus differentiation between the mainland and island at migration–selection–drift equilibrium and determine the migration rate beyond which local adaptation collapses, while accounting for genetic drift and weak linkage. Using our efficient numerical tools, we then present a detailed study of the effects of dominance on barriers to gene flow, showing that when total selection is sufficiently strong, more recessive local adaptation generates stronger barriers to gene flow. We then study how heterogeneous genetic architectures of local adaptation affect barriers to gene flow, characterizing adaptive differentiation at migration–selection balance for different distributions of fitness effects. We find that a more heterogeneous genetic architecture generally yields a stronger genome-wide barrier to gene flow and that the detailed genetic architecture underlying locally adaptive traits can have an important effect on observable differentiation when divergence is not too large. Lastly, we study the limits of our approach as loci become more tightly linked, showing that our predictions remain accurate over a large biologically relevant domain.},

	abstract = {A fundamental question in evolutionary biology concerns the relative contributions of phenotypic plasticity vs. local adaptation (genotypic specialization) in enabling wide-ranging species to inhabit diverse environmental conditions. Here, we conduct a long-term hypoxia acclimation experiment to assess the relative roles of local adaptation and plasticity in enabling highland and lowland deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) to sustain aerobic thermogenesis at progressively increasing elevations. We assessed the relative physiological performance capacities of highland and lowland natives as they were exposed to progressive, stepwise increases in hypoxia, simulating the gradual ascent from sea level to an elevation of 6,000 m. The final elevation of 6,000 m far exceeds the highest attainable elevations within the species’ range, and therefore tests the animals’ ability to tolerate levels of hypoxia that surpass the prevailing conditions within their current distributional limits. Our results demonstrate that highland natives exhibit superior thermogenic capacities at the most severe levels of hypoxia, suggesting that the species’ broad fundamental niche and its ability to inhabit such a broad range of elevational zones is attributable to genetically based local adaptation, including evolved changes in plasticity. Transcriptomic and physiological measurements identify evolved changes in the acclimation response to hypoxia that contribute to the enhanced thermogenic capacity of highland natives.},

	abstract = {Most studies of local adaptation substitute the correlation between spatial distance and environmental heterogeneity for the temporal dynamics over which local adaptation evolves. The availability of detailed ecological and genomic information from lake sediments provides an opportunity to study local adaptation with unparalleled clarity from the temporal perspective. Inference can be further enhanced by including multiple lakes along ecological axes to further isolate the effects of ecological change in driving local adaptation. Lakes throughout the world face the impact of numerous anthropogenically induced environmental changes. Top among these is the eutrophication of freshwaters from agriculture, development and land-use change. Here we use the genetic information recorded in lake sediments of two lakes experiencing contrasting histories of land-use change to study the evolution of local adaptation in the lakes’ Daphnia pulicaria populations. Utilizing nextRAD derived Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), we studied the evolutionary trajectories of Daphnia pulicaria in both lakes. Using gene-environment correlations and Fst tests for selection we found SNPs that appear to be under selection in both lakes. Specifically, we found more outlier SNPs in the highly impacted lake using Fst-based tests for selection. Conversely, gene-environment tests revealed the reverse pattern. We discuss numerous facets of experimental design that must be considered when using resurrection ecology to study local adaptation and critically evaluate how they may have impacted the results of this investigation.
Lay Summary Resurrection ecology, the resuscitation or hatching of decades or centuries old dormant eggs, seeds or cysts provides the opportunity to study evolution in action. Here, we use resurrection ecology paired with Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) genotyping to study the evolutionary responses of two populations of Daphnia pulicaria to contrasting changes in the nutrient dynamics of their respective lakes. In the lake with more drastic changes in nutrient pollution, we find a stronger shift in allele frequencies through time and at a larger number of affected genomic positions compared with the environmentally more stable lake. However, Bayesian gene-environment correlations were stronger in the more stable lake reflecting higher power to detect correlations among allele frequency change and paleo-environmental variables in this location. Our results suggest that numerous factors might impact the ability to use different methodologies to detect local adaptation over time using resurrection ecology.},

	abstract = {Environmental heterogeneity can lead to spatially varying selection, which can, in turn, lead to local adaptation. Population genetic models have shown that the pattern of environmental variation in space can strongly influence the evolution of local adaptation. In particular, when environmental variation is highly autocorrelated in space local adaptation will more readily evolve. Despite this long-held prediction, the evolutionary genetic consequences of different patterns of environmental variation have not been thoroughly explored. In this study, simulations are used to model local adaptation to different patterns of environmental variation. The simulations confirm that local adaptation is expected to increase with the degree of spatial autocorrelation in the selective environment, but also show that highly heterogeneous environments are more likely to exhibit high variation in local adaptation, a result not previously described. Spatial autocorrelation in the environment also influences the evolution and genetic architecture of local adaptation, with different combinations of allele frequency and effect size arising under different patterns of environmental variation. These differences influence the ability to characterise the genetic basis of local adaptation in different environments. Finally, I analyse a large-scale provenance trial conducted on lodgepole pine and find suggestive evidence that spatially autocorrelated environmental variation leads to stronger local adaptation in natural populations of lodgepole pine. Overall, this work emphasizes the profound importance that the spatial pattern of selection can have on the evolution of local adaptation and how spatial autocorrelation should be considered when formulating hypotheses in ecological and genetic studies.
Lay Summary Many species exhibit local adaptation to environmental variation across their ranges. Theoretical population genetics predicts that the evolution of local adaptation and patterns of genetic variation underlying it will be influenced by the spatial pattern of variation across a species’ range. However, this prediction has not been thoroughly explored for cases of complex heterogeneous landscapes. In this paper, I analyse simulations and empirical data to characterise the effects that the spatial pattern of environmental variation can have on the evolution of local adaptation and the genetics underlying it. From these analyses, I show that the pattern of environmental variation influences the average level of local adaptation, variation in local adaptation as well as the genetics underlying this important phenomenon.},

	abstract = {Urbanization frequently alters the biotic and abiotic environmental context. Variation in both the biotic and abiotic environment can result in selection mosaics that lead to locally adapted phenotypes. Ecological changes to urban environments can result in evolutionary responses across a diverse array of plants and animals, but the effects of urbanization on local adaptation and coevolution between species remain largely unstudied. Using a common garden experiment of 30 populations and 1080 plants, we tested for local adaptation in the mutualism between white clover (Trifolium repens) and rhizobia (Rhizobium leguminosarum symbiovar trifolii) along an urbanization gradient. We asked: (Q1) are white clover and rhizobia locally adapted? (Q2) Does nitrogen (N) addition mediate the strength of local adaptation? (Q3) Is the strength of local adaptation in host plants related to the strength of local adaptation in rhizobia, as expected if white clover and rhizobia are coadapting? And (Q4) how does the degree of local adaptation vary with urbanization? We found evidence for local adaptation for both white clover and rhizobia, with stronger signatures of local adaptation for rhizobia than white clover (Q1). While N addition positively affected plant biomass and negatively affected nodule density, N addition did not consistently mediate patterns of local adaptation (Q2). The strength of local adaptation was positively related between white clover and rhizobia under N addition, suggesting that soil N mediates coadaptation between white clover and rhizobia (Q3). We did not find a consistent relationship between measures of urbanization and local adaptation (Q4). Additionally, fitness responses for white clover and rhizobia were unrelated to Rhizobium abundance and local adaptation was unrelated to the broader bacterial microbiome in the soil inoculants or root endosphere. Synthesis. Our results show a spatial mosaic in local adaptation, with stronger local adaptation for rhizobia than white clover. While urbanization does influence the ecology of plant–microbe interactions, our study suggests urbanization does not disrupt local adaptation and coevolution among mutualists.},

We trace this ancestral line back into the distant past, far beyond the most recent common ancestor of the population (thus connecting population genetics to phylogeny), and analyse the mutation process along this line. To this end, we use the pruned lookdown ancestral selection graph (Lenz et al., 2015), which consists of a set of potential ancestors of the sampled individual at any given time. Relative to the neutral case (that is, without selection), we obtain a general bias towards the beneficial type, an increase in the beneficial mutation rate, and a decrease in the deleterious mutation rate. This sheds new light on previous analytical results. We discuss our findings in the light of a well-known observation at the interface of phylogeny and population genetics, namely, the difference in the mutation rates (or, more precisely, mutation fluxes) estimated via phylogenetic methods relative to those observed in pedigree studies.},

It contributes to a better understanding of human evolutionary history, advances personalized medicine, aids in forensic identification, and allows individuals to connect to their genealogical roots. Existing methods, such as ADMIXTURE, have significantly improved our ability to infer ancestries. However, these methods typically work with a fixed number of independent ancestral populations. As a result, they provide insight into genetic admixture, but do not include a hierarchical interpretation. In particular, the intricate ancestral population structures remain difficult to unravel. Alternative methods with a consistent inheritance structure, such as hierarchical clustering, may offer benefits in terms of interpreting the inferred ancestries. Here, we present tangleGen, a soft clustering tool that transfers the hierarchical machine learning framework Tangles, which leverages graph theoretical concepts, to the field of population genetics. The hierarchical perspective of tangleGen on the composition and structure of populations improves the interpretability of the inferred ancestral relationships. Moreover, tangleGen adds a new layer of explainability, as it allows identifying the SNPs that are responsible for the clustering structure. We demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of tangleGen for the inference of ancestral relationships, using both simulated data and data from the 1000 Genomes Project.},

In this work, we built a new stochastic population genetics model to fill this outstanding knowledge gap. We showed that sexual reproduction tends to suppress the fixation probability of beneficial mutants than clonal reproduction, except under overdominance. This effect is particularly large in small populations with biased sex ratios. We also found that small populations are prone to the invasion of mildly detrimental alleles when the heterozygotes have a fitness advantage. Our study highlights the pressing need to extend the research of stochastic population dynamics to consider the biology of sexual reproduction, such as allelic interactions and biased sex ratio. Our model extends the frontier of population genetics research into diploid, sexually reproducing populations and sets the foundation to explore the great variety of biological factors and processes, such as sexual selection and sexual conflict, on stochastic evolutionary dynamics. Future research in this direction will help make better predictions of the evolutionary fate of mutants in relevant contexts, including the conservation of endangered species and evolutionary rescue.},

There is therefore a need for statistical approaches in population genetics that can accommodate continuous geographic structure, and that ideally use georeferenced individuals as the unit of analysis, rather than populations or subpopulations. In addition, researchers are often interested in describing the diversity of a population distributed continuously in space; this diversity is intimately linked to both the dispersal potential and the population density of the organism. A statistical model that leverages information from patterns of isolation by distance to jointly infer parameters that control local demography (such as Wright's neighborhood size), and the long-term effective size (Ne) of a population would be useful. Here, we introduce such a model that uses individual-level pairwise genetic and geographic distances to infer Wright's neighborhood size and long-term Ne. We demonstrate the utility of our model by applying it to complex, forward-time demographic simulations as well as an empirical dataset of the two-form bumblebee (Bombus bifarius). The model performed well on simulated data relative to alternative approaches and produced reasonable empirical results given the natural history of bumblebees. The resulting inferences provide important insights into the population genetic dynamics of spatially structured populations.},

Identity-by-descent segment lengths are correlated via unobserved tree and recombination processes, which commonly presents challenges to the derivation of theoretical results in population genetics. Under interpretable regularity conditions, we show that the proportion of detectable identity-by-descent segments at a locus is normally distributed for large sample size and large scaled population size. We use efficient and exact simulations to study the distributional behavior of the detectable identity-by-descent rate in finite samples. One consequence of non-normality in finite samples is that genome-wide scans based on identity-by-descent rates may be subject to anti-conservative Type 1 error control.
HighlightsWe show the asymptotic normality of the identity-by-descent rate, a mean of correlated binary random variables that arises in population genetics studies.We describe an efficient algorithm capable of simulating long identity-by-descent segments around a locus in large sample sizes.In enormous simulation studies, we use this algorithm to characterize the distributional properties of the identity-by-descent rate.In finite samples, we reject the null hypothesis of normality more often than the nominal significance level, indicating that genome-wide scans based on identity-by-descent rates may be anti-conservative.},

Landscape genetics methods allow for studying functional connectivity in heterogenous landscapes in detail to inform conservation measures for a species’ regional persistence. Yet, for insects, functional connectivity through landscape genetics remains largely unexplored. We studied the functional connectivity in the dune-specialist digger wasp Bembix rostrata in a human-altered coastal region in Belgium based on landscape genetics methods. We used an optimization approach to correlate individual genetic distances with landscape resistance distances to deduce the conductance of natural and anthropogenic landscape categories to gene flow. Overall, the populations of this dune-specialist insect are genetically well-connected. Through multi-model inference we could detect—on top of the prominent background process of isolation- by-distance—a weak but consistent signal of urban features facilitating gene flow. However, because urbanisation leads to larger scale fragmentation, its impact on the distribution of populations in the landscape and related effective regional gene flow remains substantial. We discuss the results in the context of movement behaviour and conservation. As this species depends on early-succession dune vegetations, restoring and increasing sand dynamics at the local and landscape scale should be the focus of conservation aimed at the regional species’ persistence. This would be more effective for B. rostrata than trying to increase habitat connectivity at the landscape scale in the focal human-altered dune ecosystem.},

	abstract = {Due to their limited dispersal ability, fossorial species with predominantly belowground activity usually show increased levels of population subdivision across relatively small spatial scales. This may be exacerbated in harsh mountain ecosystems, where landscape geomorphology limits species' dispersal ability and leads to small effective population sizes, making species relatively vulnerable to environmental change. To better understand the environmental drivers of species' population subdivision in remote mountain ecosystems, particularly in understudied high-elevation systems in Africa, we studied the giant root-rat (Tachyoryctes macrocephalus), a fossorial rodent confined to the afro-alpine ecosystem of the Bale Mountains in Ethiopia. Using mitochondrial and low-coverage nuclear genomes, we investigated 77 giant root-rat individuals sampled from nine localities across its entire 1000 km2 range. Our data revealed a distinct division into a northern and southern group, with no signs of gene flow, and higher nuclear genetic diversity in the south. Landscape genetic analyses of the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes indicated that population subdivision was driven by slope and elevation differences of up to 500 m across escarpments separating the north and south, potentially reinforced by glaciation of the south during the Late Pleistocene ( 42,000–16,000 years ago). Despite this landscape-scale subdivision between the north and south, weak geographic structuring of sampling localities within regions indicated gene flow across distances of at least 16 km at the local scale, suggesting high, aboveground mobility for relatively long distances. Our study highlights that despite the potential for local-scale gene flow in fossorial species, topographic barriers can result in pronounced genetic subdivision. These factors can reduce genetic variability, which should be considered when developing conservation strategies.},
