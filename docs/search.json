A range of factors, including biotic interactions, abiotic conditions, and phylogenetic relationships is hypothesized to contribute to emergent patterns of floral color across plant communities, potentially generating overdispersed, underdispersed, or random patterns of floral color within communities. However, the generalizability of observed floral color patterns across communities remains uninvestigated for many floras. Here, we zoom in on the North American Eastern Wildflowers to ask: 1) Are species with similar colors more or less likely to co-occur in time and/or space? 2) Does the relationship between floral color and co-occurrence differ based on species relatedness? We assembled a large dataset of 1,096 species of North American flowering plants, and gathered data on floral color, phenology, distribution, and phylogenetic relationships. We selected 100 well-sampled 10 square kilometer communities and calculated metrics of community evenness in floral color categories and community phylogenetic dispersion. We found that overall, across North American Eastern wildflower communities, wildflowers are significantly more similar in color than expected by chance. However, contrary to hypotheses, the degree of over/underdispersion varied across communities, and was not not correlated with the phylogenetic over- or underdispersion of species in the community. Together, these results indicate that at the broad scale, patterns of color in wildflower communities of Northeast America are consistent with scenarios in which factors such as phylogenetic convergence filtering, and dominant pollinator preference shape emergent patterns of floral color across the landscape."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nFlowering plants display a striking amount of variation in floral color, ranging from inconspicuous greens and browns, to eye-catching reds, blues, and yellows. The diversity in floral color exhibited across the globe has led to its use as a study system for evolutionary and ecological questions, including studies of adaptation, speciation, and evolutionary developmental biology (e.g., Clegg & Durbin, 2000; Sobel & Stresfield, 2013; Erickson & Pessoa, 2022). However, despite the popularity of floral color in public and scientific arenas, the patterns of color composition across large-scale flowering plant communities remains understudied for many floras. Here, we examine the spatial distribution of broad floral colors in Northeast American flowering plants.\nSeveral hypotheses attempt to explain the distribution of floral colors across a landscape. On the one hand, we may expect biotic factors to filter or select for highly divergent floral communities, whereby species in a given community have more dissimilar floral colors than expected by chance. Pollinators in particular are known to exhibit selective pressure for divergent floral colors. Innate and learned pollinator color preferences generate divergent pollinator-mediated selection on floral color and may result in overdispersion for floral color in communities (Weiss & Papaj, 2003; Reverté et al., 2016; Muñoz-Galicia et al., 2021; Trunschke et al., 2021). Pollinator constancy, the preference of pollinators to repeatedly select flowers of a select few species or morphs, may contribute to divergent floral color within communities by incentivizing unique floral colors that attract pollinator specialists (Grossenbacher & Whittall, 2014; Erickson & Pessoa, 2022).\nAlternatively, rather than divergence, several hypotheses suggest that floral color at the community scale should display convergence or underdispersion, whereby species in the same place tend to share the same color more than expected by chance. Both biotic and abiotic factors could generate similar floral color within a community. First, species within a community are subject to similar abiotic conditions, including temperature, UV irradiance, and precipitation. As such, if abiotic factors play a significant role in shaping floral color, we might expect all flowers within a community to display similar floral colors (Willmer, 2011). For example, darker floral colors have been associated with colder regions, as their dark color may increase warmth within petals, thereby increasing pollinator attraction (Ahmad et al., 2022). Furthermore, Koski and Ashman (2016) found a strong correlation between UV pigmentation and environmental UV irradiance for flowers in the Potentilleae tribe (Rosaceae). Variations in floral pigmentation are also associated with resistance to extreme environments, particularly drought resistance (Warren & Mackenzie, 2001). At a given point in time, communities tend to have a small number of dominant pollinators. If the benefits of appealing to the color preferences of the dominant pollinator can outweigh the effects of any diverging processes, flowers in a community may tend towards the same color – specifically, the preferred color of the dominant pollinator during their blooming period (Kemp et al., 2019; Bergamo et al., 2020). Similarly, if pollinators prefer particular colors, pollinator constancy may counterintuitively incentivize convergent floral color evolution such that species can tap into the pollinators of other, similar species (Erickson & Pessoa, 2022).\nFinally, emergent patterns of floral color across communities may be random rather than over- or under-dispersed. Random emergent patterns at the community scale could occur if multiple factors hypothesized to shape the distribution of floral color occur concurrently. Additionally, although the effects of random and neutral processes on floral color require further investigation, it is not unreasonable to suspect that processes such as genetic drift and gene flow may play a noteworthy role in determining floral color (Sapir et al., 2021), which could also contribute to random patterns at the community scale.\nWhen considering patterns of floral color dispersion in communities, it is also crucial to investigate evolutionary relationships (the phylogenetic dispersion) of species therewithin. Processes that may impact over- or under-dispersion of floral color phenotypes are hypothesized to have varying effects based on the phylogenetic structure of a community. For instance, divergent floral color may prove particularly beneficial to closely related species in a community, as divergence may facilitate increased coexistence for closely related species by avoiding deleterious hybridization and reproductive interference, allowing species to sustainably co-occur in space and time despite otherwise occupying similar areas of niche space (Grossenbacher & Whitall, 2011). Alternatively, sharing floral color to attract a dominant pollinator may benefit distantly related species pairs but not closer relatives. Close relatives may also be expected to share floral color simply due to recent common ancestry (phylogenetic niche conservatism). Other floral traits, such as phenology, have been shown to exhibit high levels of trait conservatism, with congeners tending towards similar trait values (Davies et al., 2013). Thus, we may expect patterns of dispersion of floral colors in communities to shift with the relatedness of plants within that community.\nWhile studies have evaluated patterns of floral color diversity within populations or small communities, to our knowledge, there is limited research on the generalizability of hypothesized patterns of floral color dispersion on a larger, landscape scale. Here, we ask: 1) are wildflowers with similar colors more or less likely to co-flower in space across Northeastern America? And 2) Do patterns of floral color dispersion differ based on species relatedness in communities? To address our questions, we gathered data on 1,096 species of wildflower found across North America. Our dataset includes information on floral color, phenology, range, and range overlap, as well as a phylogeny of our species. We used these data to investigate floral color patterns and relationships between floral color and relatedness."

    "text": "Discussion\nFloral color is a complex trait, whose development and diversification is hypothesized to be driven by a wide range of biotic and abiotic factors. Understanding how floral color is structured in communities can provide crucial starting points for understanding the ecological drivers of color. Here, we examined the emergent patterns of floral color across common North American Eastern Wildflower communities, testing for patterns consistent with over- and under-dispersion of color relative to random patterns. We found that, across 600 10km2 communities encompassing six months of flowering and 1,096 species, floral color was significantly less evenly distributed than expected from random assemblage of species in communities. However, the phylogenetic dispersion of communities had no significant correlation with the evenness of floral color in that community. This indicates that emergent patterns of floral color diversity at the broad scale are not predictably driven by the phylogenetic relationships of species within a community. These results shed light on the drivers of floral color in communities at this scale, and suggest exciting avenues for future research to understand floral color diversity.\nPatterns of Floral Color\nWe studied 600 communities, spanning the assemblage of flowering species for 6 different months across 100 sites in Northeastern America. By evaluating the evenness of distribution of flowering species across broad color categories, we sought to identify whether communities were more or less diverse in floral color than expected by chance. We found that observed floral color evenness was significantly lower than expected by chance across communities. This result indicates that, in our study region, co-occurring wildflowers tend towards more similar colors than predicted by random assemblages. This pattern is consistent with hypothesized processes producing convergent floral color within communities. Appealing to the dominant pollinator in a given season, as well as appealing to pollinators with existing floral color preferences (pollinator constancy), may promote the co-occurrence of similar floral colors (Kemp et al., 2019; Bergamo et al., 2020; Erickson & Pessoa, 2021). Our findings suggest that convergent processes are outweighing the effects of any processes that promote divergence or overdispersion of floral colors (e.g., to reduce competition for pollinators and avoid deleterious hybridizations, Grossenbacher & Whittall, 2014; Erickson & Pessoa, 2022). Abiotic conditions, including climate and soil, may also explain how wildflower communities overcome competing biotic pressures to display convergent floral colors. The impacts of abiotic factors, such as climate and soil, on floral color is an open area of research with much work to do; further research into this area will help elucidate the role of these pressures in generating emergent patterns of floral color across landscapes (Willmer, 2011). In particular, experiments testing for evidence of similar flower colors impacting plant success in communities will be necessary to link these broad scale patterns with hypothesized processes.\nWe also identified a negative relationship between floral color evenness and species richness across communities. This negative pattern is surprising, as evenness might be expected to increase with increasing species richness; this pattern is in disagreement with Fox’s Assembly Rule, which suggests that emptier categories should be filled before fuller ones in a community (Fox & Brown 1993). This pattern is consistent with a small number of floral color categories becoming increasingly dominant as species richness increases. Fortunately, our permutation-style tests against a null hypothesis of random assemblage are robust with respect to species richness. Future research may seek to disentangle which, if any, floral colors exhibit dominance in communities, and how floral color is assembled with respect to species richness. This result also lends itself to new hypotheses to explore – for instance, are emergent patterns of floral color driven in part by species richness at a site? Is it more beneficial to have a rare floral color in communities with fewer species, while in communities with more species it is more beneficial to display the locally dominant floral color?\nIncorporating Species Relationships\nInterestingly, when accounting for phylogenetic relationships within our communities, we saw no significant correlation between a communities’ evenness of distribution across color categories and its phylogenetic over- or underdispersion. Our study included multiple communities showing notable phylogenetic over- and underdispersion, yet the floral color distribution in these sites was no different than communities with less notable phylogenetic relationships. This suggests that phylogenetically structured processes are not a key driver of the floral color similarity patterns observed across communities at this scale.\nOur study did not explicitly address flower color evolutionary rates across clades. However, future work with higher phylogenetic resolution could incorporate information on the degree of phylogenetic signal in flower color across subclades. For example, if floral color is phylogenetically conserved, we may expect to see significantly less even floral color distributions in phylogenetically underdispersed communities, as the close relatives in these would be expected to occupy similar color categories. The resolution of our phylogeny, with polytomies for all congeners, limits our ability to make detailed estimates of phylogenetic patterns, and may mask correlations between phylogenetic relationships and color evenness. Future research into floral color and phylogenetic patterns across communities using more detailed data, including higher-resolution phylogenies are a clear next step in this area.\nStudy Limitations & Future Directions\nOur study is, to our knowledge, the first of its kind to assemble such a large dataset of color in Northeastern American wildflowers. Due to the number of species involved in our study, many aspects of our data have room for further exploration. Our phenology, phylogeny, and color data could all be improved by approaches to using citizen science, including the creation of novel methods to acquire wildflower color data from citizen science imagery (Barve et al., 2020). By combining our methods with higher quality data on wildflower traits, we may be able to further strengthen our understanding of the drivers of floral color diversity.\nFurther, while the average evenness of color in our wildflower communities is significantly lower than expected by chance, additional analyses and more data may reveal other emergent patterns of floral color. We were limited by computational power, but future research should encompass more than 100 spatial communities across the north east. Additionally it will be important to account for spatial and temporal non-independence of sites in future work. Such research may uncover other patterns, including convergent mechanisms discussed above, but also including random ones such as drift, and divergent ones such as competition for pollinators. Regardless, this study represents a powerful first step in investigating the emergent patterns of flower color across communities at the broad scale."
