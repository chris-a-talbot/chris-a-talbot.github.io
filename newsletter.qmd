#### Background

Population genetic models provide a theoretical framework from which to evaluate evolutionary scenarios. This paper contributes to the literature on population genetic models in well-mixed (random mating) constant-size populations. The Wright-Fisher model is one of the oldest population genetic models, dating back to the 1930s. It uses discrete, non-overlapping generations, where each individual dies and is replaced by one new individual in each generation. The Moran model allows for continuous, overlapping generations, where at any given time, one individual may die and be replaced by one new individual. Chia and Watterson (1969) generalized these two models by allowing individuals to reproduce independently, then populating the next generation using a random fraction of parents and offspring from the previous generation. This model generalizes both Wright-Fisher and Moran models for particular proportions of parents to offspring in subsequent generations. However, the Chia and Watterson model is highly mathematically complex, making it difficult to study the properties of the model. The model is so complex that the probability of fixation for a particular mutant haplotype in this model has never been derived.

#### Key Points

Alexandre et al. developed a model that tracks evolution in well-mixed populations of constant size by updating a proportion of the population randomly in discrete intervals. This model generalizes to the Wright-Fisher model (when the entire population is updated at each time step) and the Moran model (when one individual is updated at each time step). It is mathematically simpler than previous generalizations of these two models, allowing for the straight-forward derivation of the fixation probability of mutant alleles in the population.
